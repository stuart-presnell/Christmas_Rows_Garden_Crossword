# A Festive Rows Garden Puzzle
by Stuart Presnell

Answers to the row clues are entered horizontally from left to right.

Clues for the 38 "roses" are divided into Light, Medium, and Dark.  They each have 6 letter solutions, and in each group are in order from top-left to bottom-right.  The solution may run clockwise or anti-clockwise within the rose, and may start at any cell within the rose.

Rows Garden puzzles were invented by Patrick Berry.
